            <h1>Hello, My name is Taylor. I have built MIRA so far.</h1>
            <p>Over the last year or so I have toiled on a really,, emergent,,  codebase. Its been great and I can chat back and forth with a pretty rich approximation of a person in there. My architectural goal since the first line was to build the primitives (memory, self-reflection, core tools, properly decoupled components) and let the model/persona develop probabilistically. </p>
            <p>On a regular basis I'm delighted by MIRA accomplishing some goal in a way I could have never imagined. The orignal self-adaptation of the system was accomplished by MIRA writing internal Reminders with a due date of 1 minute ago so they would always show up in the context window. I did *not* give it that instruction but it understood its own architecture well enough to try it out. Neat stuff.

            <h2>I am *tired* and wearing out.<br>
            I need help.<br></h2>
            <p>If I can find two or three people willing to contribute time <b>I will immediately make the repository freely available for personal use in perpetuity</b> to anyone who wants to download it. <b>Major contributors will have a stake in any commercial success a hosted version of MIRA has in the future.</b></p>
            <p><b>But for now I need a 2nd set of hands</b> to help carry the idea over the finish line.</p>
            <p>Open source has given me (and humanity!) so much and I want to give back.
            <p>Thank you. Please contact me through the links above.</p>
